[jQuery Background effect] (http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/)
 
* The first plug in is my background photo. I wanted my resume to match my website because I will probably be linking to it. So I chose to use the background image for my website, I actually did look for other tutorials but did not find any that I liked as much as Backstretch. I chose not to do the slideshow because I think it would be too distracting.

* The second plugin is supposed to be a hover effect for my contact info buttons but it does not work. I'm not getting back any errors, but what is supposed to happen does not happen. You can see it change to a different mouse clicker when you hover, so something is working properly. If you could please take a look and see what I am doing wrong and how I could improve this, thank you!

* Following along in class it made a lot of sense and seemed simple. However, I could not find plugins that would work for me. The tutorials were either too complicated for me to follow their instructions or something would produce errors. I found this whole jQuery thing to be an extremely frustrating part of the assignment. 
* I also did not see a ton of great plugins outside of photo effects. As I am not doing a slide show for resume, I stayed away from the slideshows. Everything else I do not think would fit on a resume where you want it to be simple. The majority of hover effects that I liked were mostly CSS animation, which I also find to be extremly more user friendly.
